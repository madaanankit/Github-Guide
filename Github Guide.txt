Repository is like a folder where all your related files are stored.
Staging area is a place where all the files are stored before commit.
Branches are a way to seperate your live code from the code that is currently in development.
There can be any number of branches and a branch can also have other branches.
Change in one branch does not affect other branches.
If there are some files which you do not want git to keep track of, you can add those file names in .gitignore file.
